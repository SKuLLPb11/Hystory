            <p>Italian culture is steeped in the arts, family, architecture, music and food. Home of the Roman Empire and its legendary figures such as Julius Caesar and Nero, it was also a major center of the Renaissance and the birthplace of fascism under Benito Mussolini</p>

            <h1>CASTLE SANT ANGELO in Rome</h1>
            <h3>You may have the universe if I may have ITALY</h3>
            <p>The mausoleum was converted to a castle in the year 280 when the Aurelian walls were built around it. The castle occupied a good strategic position on the Tiber river. <br>However, the castle was still sacked twice in 410 and 537, and many of the cover stones of most of the funerary urns were destroyed. Because the Vatican would later fall outside the city walls and turned out to be difficult to defend,<br> Castel Sant Angelo was connected to the Vatican by a tunnel in 1722.<br> This way, the castle served as a refuge for the Pope and treasure chamber to secure the valuable church possessions in case of an attack on the Vatican and the St. Peter's Basilica.</p>

            <h1>AUTHENTICITY</h1>
            <p>The Castel Sant'Angelo was built in the 2nd century as a mausoleum by order of emperor Hadrian.<br> The mausoleum did not become associated with the name of archangel Michael until 590, when Pope Gregory I saw archangel Michael sheathe his sword on top of the mausoleum during a plague to signal the end of the epidemic.<br> Later pope Pius II built a chapel at the site where the archangel was said to have appeared.<br> The remarkable bronze statue of archangel Michael was made in 1753 by Peter Anton von Verschaffelt.<br> The Castle of the Holy Angel in Rome also owes a lot of its fame to the film adaptation of Dan Brown's Angels & Demons, where the castle served as a hideout for the Illuminati.</p>
