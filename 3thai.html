            <h1>THAILAND</h1> 
            <p>The culture of Thailand has evolved greatly over time, from its relative isolation during the Sukhothai era, to its more contemporary <br>Ayutthaya era, which absorbed influences from all over Asia. Indian, Chinese, Burmese, Khmer and other Southeast Asian influences are still evident in traditional Thai culture.</p>

            <h1>HISTORIC CITY OF AYUTTHAYA</h1>
            <h3>"There is no other happiness but peace"</h3>
            <p>The Historic City of Ayutthaya, founded in 1350, was the second capital of the Siamese Kingdom. <br> It flourished from the 14th to the 18th centuries, during which time it grew to be one of the world's largest and most cosmopolitan urban areas and a center of global diplomacy and commerce.<br> Ayutthaya was strategically located on an island surrounded by three rivers connecting the city to the sea. This site was chosen because it was located above the tidal bore of the Gulf of Siam as it existed at that time,<br>thus preventing attack of the city by the sea-going warships of other nations. The location also helped to protect the city from seasonal flooding.</p>

            <h1>AUTHENTICITY</h1>
            <p>The Historic City of Ayutthaya is well-known from historical records.  As one of the world's largest cities of its time and a major political, economic and religious center, many visitors recorded facts about the city and their experiences there.<br>  The Siamese Royal Court also kept meticulous records; many were destroyed in the sack of the city, but some have remained and are an important source of authenticity.<br> The same can be said for the testimony of works of art, wall painting, sculpture, and palm leaf manuscripts which survive from the period. <br>Of particular note are the surviving mural paintings in the crypt of Wat Ratchaburana. Careful attention to the accurate <br>interpretation of the ruins to the public for educational purposes also contributes to the property's authenticity.</p>
